   - Note any risks, opportunities, or sector-wide headwinds/tailwinds.

‚úÖ Actionable Insight for a Financial Analyst**

üí¨ Simple Explanation (Plain English)**

   - Avoid jargon. Use analogies if helpful (e.g., "The company made more money than expected this quarter, mostly due to strong sales and keeping costs low.").
